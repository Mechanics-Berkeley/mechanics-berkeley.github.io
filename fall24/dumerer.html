                11/19, 2024 at 11:10AM-12:00PM in 3110 Etcheverry (for in-person talks) and <a href="https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/95785043475">https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/95785043475</a>
            </h5>
            <p>Analysis of microscopy datasets acquired on biological samples and their interactions with surfaces can provide valuable insight for investigating pathogens. Developing machine learning-based segmentation models to quickly and efficiently isolate and quantify relevant biological features has become essential in biohazard prevention efforts. This talk will discuss my research with Oak Ridge National Lab to pair machine learning with AFM imaging to combat future biohazards.

			<p> Blythe Dumerer completed her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from The Ohio State University before beginning her Ph.D.  journey at UC Berkeley in the Berkeley Biomechanics Lab. She developed an interest in combining aspects of engineering and the health field through her aims to create positive changes in the community around her.</p>
