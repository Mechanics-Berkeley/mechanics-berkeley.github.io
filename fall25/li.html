            <p><b>Abstract:</b> 
				When an asteroid enters the Earth`s atmosphere, extreme aerodynamics and
                thermal load induced by hypersonic flow interactions cause the object to
                disintegrate, in what is known as an airburst.
                Traditionally, airburst events are simulated as a fluid-structure interaction
                problem, where an inlet boundary condition will send in air particles at
                hypersonic speed to form a bow shock on a bolide. Due to its computational
                complexity, other reduce-order models, such as surrogating the hypersonic
                flow field with an equivalent surface pressure force, are also used.
                We propose a novel hybrid approach for simulating airburst events
                using Spheral++, an open-source smoothed particle hydrodynamics code
                maintained at Lawerence Livermore National Lab with a Fluid-Solid Interface
                adaptation. Utilizing this approach, we can achieve high-fidelity simulations
                while reducing the computational complexity. We validate our approach by
                comparing the kinetic energy curve with full two-phase simulations while
                varying diﬀerent parameters.</p>

			<p><b>About the speaker:</b> 
				Ian V. Li is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley,
                advised by Professor Panos Papadopoulos. His primary research area is
                understanding the thermomechanical behavior of highly heterogeneous
                materials using computational homogenization. In addition, he is interested
                in utilizing data science techniques to develop eﬃcient surrogate models
                of complex physical phenomena. He completed his B.S. in Civil and
                Environmental Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science, at the
                University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2020.</p>
